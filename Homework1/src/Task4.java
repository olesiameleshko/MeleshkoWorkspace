/* Comparison between Integer and Float

Definition:
- Integers can be described as whole numbers meaning that they do not have any fractional parts.
- Float or floating point numbers possess a fixed specific number of bits which are arranged for the whole number
and the fractional portion of the number.

Representation:
- Integer data types can be represented in three number systems (Decimal, Octal and Hexadecimal)
- Float can be only written using a decimal number system

Memory requirement:
- Generally, integer data types require 2 bytes of memory
- Generally, float data types require 4 bytes of memory

Example:
-125, 567, 4,667
1.2e34, 0.98

Origin:
- From Latin integer meaning literally "untouched," hence "whole"
- The location of decimal and binary point moves around, therefore named as floating numbers or float.

Data type Integers:
- Byte - 1 byte of information (8 bits), Range from -128 to 127
Short - 2 bytes, Range from -32768 to 32767
Int - 4 bytes, Range from -2147483648 to 2147483647
Long - 8 bytes, Range from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808  to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
- Occupies 32 bits (4 bytes) and its significand has a precision of 24 bits (about 7 decimal digits). */
